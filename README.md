Inventory Management & Sales Analytics – SQL Project

📌 Overview
This project simulates a small transport company’s inventory system. I use SQL (MySQL v8) to create tables, insert sample data, and run analytical queries to gain meaningful business insights like sales performance, inventory value, low-stock alerts, and supplier analytics.

## 🧱 Tables Used
- **inventory** – Stock items with quantity and price
- **sales** – Sale transactions
- **purchases** – Purchase transactions from suppliers
- **supplier** – Supplier details

## 🔍 Key SQL Concepts
- JOINs (INNER, LEFT)
- Aggregation (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
- Grouping (GROUP BY, HAVING)
- Filtering (WHERE, CASE)
- Business logic implementation in SQL

## 📊 Sample Queries Implemented
- Total inventory value
- Top-selling products
- Profit by product
- Supplier performance
- Category-wise valuation
- Remaining stock after sales
- Low stock alerts

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- SQL (MySQL 8.0)
- OneCompiler Online Editor

## How to Run
1. Copy the contents of `init.sql` into your MySQL editor and run it to create the database and insert sample data.
2. Copy the contents of `queries.sql` into your MySQL editor and run them to get the analysis outputs.
3. Modify sample data as per your business needs.
